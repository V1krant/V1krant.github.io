  <h3>Javascript and the DOM</h3>

  <p>The Javascript and the DOM is got to be for me at least the most fascinating things I've learned about so far.  The DOM is the file structure of a website and with this, we can "look over" the site and get a sort of bird's eye view of what's going on and what the contents are of the website. This is awesome when we couple this with Javascript now we can start to inject things, toggle things in and out, delete things.  We have do have full control over the DOM and all its contents with Javascript. Imagine being able to delete a blog post underneath the viewed post you're looking at and place posts, ads, information underneath…. and it's not far of a stretch to think how some tech giants implement algorithms that pull and place things into your feed they think you like.</p>
 
  <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
  <p>This brings me to how do we store that information and pull it out when we need it. One way is to use an array which you can use a word to store lots of information, you can imagine this by thinking of it as a sort of a shopping list inside of brackets and as you go down the list you count down from 0 being the first and the last number being whatever is last on your shopping list which is great because we can store and pull so many items in it! But in arrays we store information that is the “same of its kind”, like food we have here! Now if we wanted the 10th item on the list all we’d have to do is put in our grocery list name and the number 9. Sadly in programming, we count from 0 haha. Now there is another way we can store these and it is with objects! They are similar, but instead of pulling information out with the word or value then a number, you have to state the word and then a keyword you have given to your “value” or information.</p>
 
  <h3>Example of an Array and a Object</h3>

  <h3>A little analogy for HTML and CSS</h3>
  <p>I gain inspiration from a fellow cohort for this: HTML and CSS are like best friends in the sense that one friend “HTML” prefers to be the builder, he's better at building and laying down the foundations for a house. And CSS is the friend that loves helping with the decorating of the house and making it feel more homely. They can both work together to make something amazing.</p>

  <h3>What are Functions and why are they useful</h3>
  <p>Functions are like when we are called to do "task" you do when its called for eg. vacuum cleaning the house. These are useful for "calling" or asking a task to be done and complete a functions.</p>
  
  <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
  <p>A quote from MDN Web Docs I think is great describing the control flow which is how your computer reads the code you've given it which is top to bottom and anything in between that can change the flow a bit eg. going from bottom back to top again, but will always go from top to bottom. "Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops."</p>
  <p>Loops are similar as they have a function but they also have a conditional which that go to as in "Me hanging out the washing at home till everything is all hung out", these are a awesome tool in coding!</p>
