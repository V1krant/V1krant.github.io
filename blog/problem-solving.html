  <h3>Here's a short story of a situation I ended up in at one time</h3>

   <p>
    One time me and myself went to the bank to deposit some cash and coins into a smart machine, I had some spare change. Here I am at the bank and I put the cash in and deposited everything into the smart machine and it just spat my coins and cash out but still put the money in my account... Odd?.. "great right"?!.. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Well no.. If I kept the "doubled money", I would of been guilty of theft haha. So I went to the teller and said what had happened, they insisted everything was ok! So I went back and desposited my cash again and... bam it's done it again!??! I wondered what the hell is going on. I mean i'm not doing anything wrong and this is happening. 
    </p>
    <p>
    So back I went to the teller again and we came to the conclusion that it wasn't my fault so I used another machine as requested and it worked okay. Turns out the machine was broken but it was repling it was okay, and I ended up with $14 extra cash in my bank account that they didn't care about after talking with the teller.. I mean free money haha. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't trust people or machines they can be wrong sometimes, trust your gut.
