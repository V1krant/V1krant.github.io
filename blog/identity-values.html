<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:</h3>

<p> There was a time in my life where I was put with the decision to help out someone doing illegal activities which could of landed me with a trespassing notice and choosing not to engage steered me clear of any ill-well coming my way from the fall-out. Don’t worry it was just doing burn out’s in car parks lol.</p>

<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h3>

<p> My culture as in my family I grew up have influenced me to be helpful, caring and to try have mutual respect for everyone I come in contact with.<br>
Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</p>

<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h3>

<p>Strengths: Confident, Team Playing, Loyal, Risk-Taking.</p>

<h3>Limitations: Being confident and risk taking is great but overly so can lead to some undesirable results when understanding your undertakings in a learning experience or workplace:</h3>

<p>Being loyal can lead to confrontations especially when someone is talking negatively of that person.</p>

<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:</h3>

<p>Being confident when the storms of life hit that everything will be alright is incredibly powerful and has gotten me through so much. And learning wise this is helpful in that whatever you're going through will be either learnt or be done with soon.</p>
 <br>
<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why:</h3>

<p>I’ve seen this happen. Sometimes when talking with people you won’t agree on everything that is only natural, but for some people they take this as a offence that they aren't listening to them or validating what they believe in. This is where mutual respect is key and having the understanding everyone has the right to believe in whatever they want to.<br>
