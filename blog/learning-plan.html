  <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

  <p>To pursue a career in web development and continue learning along the way of other ways of coding. I’d love to get more competent in understanding and applying code in the long term.</p>
  
  <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
  <p>Taking care of the big 3 health aspects mental, physical and sleep these a must with me can't go without them, over-time I have learnt to manage better than I used to.</p><p>Cheerful: Is useful going into things with a better attitude.<br>
  Strong minded/willed: Leads me down some learning holes sometimes but that’s all part of it, really good otherwise for being persistent in learning and leads to good focus.<br>
  Relaxed: I’m usually quite a relaxed dude, learning in a in time manner has sharpened this part of me through being relaxed in a way and focused at the same time.</p>
  <p>Courage: Can come off as a bit "yolo" sometimes but thats just it goes hand in hand, it's been a adventure finding out what i can actually handle without going bottom under</p>
  
  <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  
  <p>Just to be more confident in talking about myself and have a deeper understanding of what that is.</p>
  
  <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h3>
  
  <p>I usually take my time on things. If I don’t get it I will take a step back and have a break, think about what I am trying to do and move on, otherwise it's just taking regular interval breaks, going outside or exercising which helps improve my wood and focus. Being persistent is important.</p>
  <p>Having a mutuel respect with everyone is key to building a safe and healthy environment when working with others.</p>
  
  <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h3>
  
  <p>I think of this as a past tense that has already happened in the sense I left somethings to the last minute. What I'll do is take a step back and take a deep breath, reassess my management of time and effort if I need to and move on.</p>
  
  <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
  
  <p>I’ll reach out to my cohorts first then a facilitator if I need a hand with something.</p>
  
  <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
  
  <p>Support when in need, I feel is a great thing some other “Course” like institutions don’t have.<br>
