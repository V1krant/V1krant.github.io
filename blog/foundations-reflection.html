<h3 style="font-size: 45px;">Reflections on Reflections?... No Foundations.</h3>
<br>
<h2 class="stylehs">What surprised me the most about learning core is...</h2>
<p>
  When I apply myself i'm able to do whatever eg. learning how to code or just doing a blog.
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  Found that when you really put your mind to something you can achieve anything and if that means ignoring this so called "ego" be it so. 
  Your ego is yourself really and sometimes when you change your mind and body it has a hard time recognizing this kinda like meta intelligence, it's like putting yourself into a new pair of shoes and things feel so different.. Sometimes it tends to fight the change that has happened in us, this I call a balancing faze.
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
<p>
  Values: 
</p>
<p>
  This will determine what you pick as a good way to problem solve in a programming situation and how you go about your learning process.
  </p>
<p>Empathy: </p>
<p>
  The use of the word empathy with programming is interesting and I find it as your putting your head in the stand point of the code, what is the code doing here and following whats going on in it. The use in learning would be to perceive how people are feeling and thinking about things then applying your knowledge to it to maybe bring a better understand on a subject.
</p>
<p>Self-awareness:</p>
<p>
  "Knowing why you want to become or are a Programmer. A true and clear inner sense of awareness of your true skills, interests and characteristics which act as your foundation for your journey like a compass or navigation." actually sums this up perfectly in both programming and learning "Why do I want to learn this?", these questions are really good for problem solving too.
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  I didn't know what I getting myself into with the self driven learning and the human skills. Who would of thought programming and human skills go so well.
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  I found the perseverance to read through everything thoroughly understand it and apply it, being the more human skills area's and some of the programming was the hardest for me, but also the most rewarding. 
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
<p>
  There's many ways of thinking about this... One could be that your a school and want to be a kind of "foundation" or start point for programming, so having everyone on the same page of how to learn properly is the best way to produce good coders and set a good precedent.
  And the fact is we all learn differently and it is important we understand this ourselves. to have this so called "open space" time where learning is self driven will only grow yourself.
</p>
<h2 class="stylehs">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
<p>
  Yes and no being the short answer to this. Yes it did feel like it was a sort of waste of time and couldn't understand why it is we are learning this at first haha, but then no at the end it made sense and i'm grateful for what i've learnt so far, because without this knowledge of EQ, neuroplasticity, problem solving, I don't think i'd be where i am now... These are such great "tools"!
